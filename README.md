# Level_Generation
This is work following the paper "Bootstrapping Conditional GANs for Video Game Level Generation" but for use with our own video game. 
The SAGAN architecture is based on paper "Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks" and the following github repositories: https://github.com/brain-research/self-attention-gan and https://github.com/brain-research/self-attention-gan/blob/master/generator.py. If you wish to only use the SAGAN architecture on images, I recommend using either of those two resposititories. Also, if you use this repository in any work please be sure to cite the previously mentioned papers and github repositories.
